This is an online game shopping website designed and developed as a POC, I used all the images and data from the local JSON file and fetched all the data using asyn await and mapped all the data accordingly using template literals. 
user sign in data and add to cart items are stored in local storage so that when the page is refreshed the data is not lost.
The info of each game is looped through each card when clicked it shows the info is the game
I have used simple javascript concepts and no frameworks are used.
